9-Walls Quest
by Daniel Solis
Consciousness QFT Advanced Toy Model

Features:

Interactive parameter controls for all key variables (g, P, χ, γ, θ)
Four synchronized charts matching your original plots
Real-time computation using simplified quantum dynamics
φ-reproducibility checklist with status indicators
Responsive grid layout

Implementation Notes:

Used simplified quantum simulation since full QuTiP functionality isn't available in browser
Implemented key physics: damped oscillations, metric emergence, Bayesian β evolution, PSD analysis
All calculations run client-side with math.js for FFT operations
Charts use logarithmic scales where appropriate (PSD plot)

The model captures the essential φ-fixed point dynamics, decoherence suppression, and emergence signatures from the original python code (included in this repository) while running entirely in the browser. Simple-to-adjust parameters and re-run to explore the parameter space.
